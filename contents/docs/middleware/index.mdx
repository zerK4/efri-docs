title: The middlewares
---

Efri has a middleware system that allows you to add functionality & checks to your routes.

You already have 2 demo middlewares in Efri, the `logger` and the `auth` middlewares.

<Note type="warning">
This is still work in progress, and the middleware system is not yet stable and will for sure be changing in the future.
</Note>

## Configuration

Run the following command to create a new middleware file:

```bash
bun efri make:middleware <name>
```

This will create a new middleware file in the `src/middlewares` directory.

```ts
import { middlewareStack } from "efri/core/middlewares";

export default middlewareStack.register("TestOne", {
  async handle(req: Request, next: () => Promise<Response>): Promise<Response> {
    return await next();
  },
});
```

Make use of it.

```ts
router.get('/my-route', ({ req, res }) => {
  return res.json({ message: 'New route to test the middleware' });
}, ['TestOne']);

// or

router.get('/my-route', [MyController, 'index'], ['TestOne']);
```
