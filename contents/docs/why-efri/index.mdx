There are a lot, a loooot of frameworks out there. Some are great, some are not. Efri is something that i could not find. 
It's a framework that is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use. It's built on top of [`bun`](https://bun.sh) with typescript, 
and it's designed to be modular and extensible, like [`Laravel`](https://laravel.com)(not at that level tho. Yet!).

It is opinionated, of course, it cares about what you do and where you put your code. 

You don't need an ORM to play with the database, it got you covered with the build-in models and with the specially designed ORM.

You don't need to chain routes like `router.get('/users').get('/{user}')`(i find this a pain) by default, 
it got you covered with the build-in router.

Just create a routes folder (it should be there already) and add your routes there, whatever name you want for the files.

Enough with the chit-chat, let's get to the point. [Installation](/docs/installation),
