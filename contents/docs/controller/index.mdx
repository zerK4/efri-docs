title: The router
---

The `Router` class is a singleton-based routing system designed for handling HTTP requests. It allows defining routes, grouping them, and applying middleware.

<Note type="warning">
The base controller `Controller` class is subjected to change, i know for sure there are things to add, don't know if there is anything to remove.
</Note>

### Usage

1. Create a controller file.

```bash
bun efri make:controller UserController
```
This will create a controller looking like this:

```ts
import { Controller } from "efri/core/controllers/Controller";
import type { RouterContext } from "efri/core/types/router";

export class UserController extends Controller {
  public async index({ res }: RouterContext): Promise<Response> {
    return res.json({ message: "Hello World" });
  }
}
```

2. Use it in your routes.

```ts
router.get('/users', [UserController, 'index']);
```
