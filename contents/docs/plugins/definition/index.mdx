### Intro

Currently you can create two type of plugins, a route plugin, and a response helper.

How is this helpfull? Well, for packages(which are not yet ready to be created/published or installed), the packages will allow external plugins to be added to your project.
Think of a plugin like the [debugbar for laravel](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar), it will allow you to return project crucial information from the backend directly to your frontend. Monitoring plugins, etc. endles possibilities.

### Creating a plugin

Run the command

```bash
bun efri make:plugin <name> --route // this can be response or route
```

This will create a plugin inside of `src/plugins` with the name you provided and content resembling to this.

```ts
import type { RoutePlugin } from "efri/core/types/routes";
import { UserController } from "../../controllers/UserController";

const dynamicRoutesPlugin: RoutePlugin = {
  name: "dynamic-routes",
  type: "route-plugin",
  routes: [
    {
      handler: [UserController, "index"], // Use the controller class and the method you want to call
      method: "GET", // HTTP method
      path: "/dynamic/route", // Route path
      middleware: [], // Middleware
      file: "./src/plugins/dynamic.ts", // File path, helps to determine if the route is from a plugin or not
    },
  ],
};

export default dynamicRoutesPlugin;
```

Now go to `http://localhost:3000/dynamic/route` and you should see the response from the `UserController`.
