### Intro

Currently you can create one type of plugin, a route plugin, a plugin which will let you inject routes in the `Router` class.

How is this helpfull? Well, for packages(which are not yet ready to be created/published or installed), the packages will allow external plugins to be added to your project.
Think of a plugin like the [debugbar for laravel](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar), it will allow you to return project crucial information from the backend directly to your frontend. Monitoring plugins, etc. endles possibilities.

### Creating a plugin

You already should have the `plugins` folder in `src` of your efri project, if not created it.

Create a plugin, whatever name you prefer and add something like this:

```ts
import type { RoutePlugin } from "efri/core/types/routes";
import { UserController } from "../../controllers/UserController";

const dynamicRoutesPlugin: RoutePlugin = {
  name: "dynamic-routes",
  type: "route-plugin",
  routes: [
    {
      handler: [UserController, "index"], // Use the controller class and the method you want to call
      method: "GET", // HTTP method
      path: "/dynamic/route", // Route path
      middleware: [], // Middleware
      file: "./src/plugins/dynamic.ts", // File path, helps to determine if the route is from a plugin or not
    },
  ],
};

export default dynamicRoutesPlugin;
```

With this being done, you can go on the terminal and hit `bun efri routes:list`, you should see something like this:
```text
üìç Application Routes:

  File: src/routes/default.ts
    ‚ñ∏ GET    / (line: 1)
    ‚ñ∏ GET    /{user} (line: 16)
    ‚ñ∏ POST   /create (line: 17)

üì¶ Plugin Routes:

  Plugin: dynamic
    ‚ñ∏ GET    /dynamic/route
```

Now go to `http://localhost:3000/dynamic/route` and you should see the response from the `UserController`.
