description: Installation process for Efri framework

Trust me, it's easy, so easy, just do:

```bash
bunx create-efri
```

## What this does?

1. Creates a new project in the current directory, default name is `my-efri-app`
2. Configure the database you want to use
3. Installs the dependencies
4. Initializes the git repository

Make sure to update your env with credentials for your database if you selected anything else than sqlite.

By default there is a migration with the name `create_users_table` that you can use to create your first table.

That's it! You're ready to go.
