description: The plugin system for the core logger

You can create a logger plugin, which will let you enhance the core logger.

There are three types of logger plugins at this moment, coming from core.

1. Console Logger Plugin
2. File Logger Plugin
3. JSON File Logger Plugin

This are created inside `/core/plugins/logger` folder and are autodiscovered by Efri.

### Creating a logger plugin 

You can use this command

```bash
bun efri make:plugin <name> --logger
```

The command will create a file in the `plugins` folder, with the name you provided, and inside it will be a plugin with a `log` method.

```ts
import type { LoggerConfig, LogLevel } from "efri/core/types";
import type { IPlugin } from "efri/core/types/plugin";

export default {
  name: "file",
  type: "logger",
  methods: {
    log: (
      level: LogLevel,
      message: any,
      context: any,
      config: LoggerConfig
    ): void => {
      // Do your thing..
    },
  },
} satisfies IPlugin;
```

Make sure the name of your new plugin is unique and found in the `logger.ts` config file as the type, depending how you want to log your data.
