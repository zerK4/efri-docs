You can create a route plugin, which will allow you to interact with the Router and push routes from outside the routes directory.

### Creating a plugin

Run the command:

```bash
bun efri make:plugin <name> --route
```

This will create a plugin inside of `src/plugins` with the name you provided and content resembling to this.

```ts
import { UserController } from "@/controllers/UserController";
import type { IPlugin } from "efri/core/types/plugin";

export default {
  name: "TestOne",
  type: "route-plugin",
  routes: [
    {
      handler: [UserController, "index"], // Use the controller class and the method you want to call
      method: "GET", // HTTP method
      path: "/dynamic/route", // Route path
      middleware: [], // Middleware
      file: "./src/plugins/dynamic.ts", // File path, helps to determine if the route is from a plugin or not
    },
  ],
} satisfies IPlugin;
```

Now go to `http://localhost:3000/dynamic/route` and you should see the response from the `UserController`.
