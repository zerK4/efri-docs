description: The logging system of Efri

<Note type="warning">
The logger is still work in progress, and the logger system is not yet stable or configurable.
</Note>

The logger can be used like this:
```ts
import { logger } from "efri/core/logger";

logger.info('This is an info message');
logger.warn('This is a warning message');
logger.error('This is an error message');
```

This will log the message to the console, and also to the `./logs/app.log` file.

<Note type="success">
Configuration to come soon.
